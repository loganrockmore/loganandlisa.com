					<h4>The story!</h4>
					
					We both spent November 3rd, 2020 volunteering for thirteen hour shifts as poll workers during the General Election. Since we were stationed at two separate polling sites, we didn&rsquo;t see each other all day (for probably the first time in about three years, thanks to vanlife and the pandemic!). The next afternoon, after an <i>extremely</i> long night of rest, we were about to head out for an outdoor lunch.  As we were getting ready to leave, Lisa noticed that she was feeling a little off and had realized that looking back she&rsquo;d felt a little different for a week or so.  On a hunch, she took a pregnancy test and we were both so thrilled when we saw a very definitive little plus sign confirm that she was indeed pregnant!  Ever since, we&rsquo;ve been excitedly preparing for a new member of our family!<br /><br />
					
					We also have very specifically not figured out the sex of the baby (including shielding our eyes during all ultrasounds when the helpful nurse tells us to!).  We&rsquo;re doing our best to keep it a complete secret until the birth!<br /><br />
					
					Oh, and what&rsquo;s the story behind the nickname Baby Pebblemore? A good friend of ours was extremely elated when he found out that we are expecting and sleepily muttered to his partner right before bed &ldquo;Logan and Lisa are having a baby! It&rsquo;s a Pebblemore!&rdquo; It was delightful, we absolutely love it and it&rsquo;s become Baby Rockmore&rsquo;s nickname ever since.

					<h4>Photos and videos!</h4>
					
					Rather than oversharing on social media, we are going to be using an app called Tiny Beans. Using it, we can privately share photos and videos of our little one to all of our family and friends. We&rsquo;ve already started adding some ultrasound and baby bump photos there!<br /><br />
					If you&rsquo;re interested in joining Tiny Beans, you can just provide us with your information and we will send you an invite.<br /><br />

					We feel so honored that people want to buy gifts for the newest member of our family. We are in the very fortunate position where we can afford all of the new supplies and goodies for the baby, but if you really do feel like you want to get us something, you can do so here, and thank you so much!<br /><br />
